Day 1:

- I will follow a tutorial on YouTube about making a TDS game with Godot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXkkNSfxLRI&list=PLpwc3ughKbZexDyPexHN2MXLliKAovkpl
- The plan is only to learn how to include basic features in this game, such as character movement, shooting mechanics, enemies, etc.
- After that's done, I will add some flavor of my own to make this game look good and unique compared to other TDS games
- For today, I'll figure out how to include the game files in this repository since I haven't used GitHub for a while
- After that, I'll create a character and write code that allows the player to move around
